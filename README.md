# Steam-Blocker

Simple batch and powershell script to find steam.exe and block / unblock outgoing traffic by opening an elevated powershell window (hidden).

My goal with this was creating a 'simple', 1 file solution for this problem, but readability suffered for it.
There are other, more elegant solutions uploaded, recommend using those instead.
